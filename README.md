# User Management API

The **User Management API** is an ASP.NET Core Web API designed to efficiently manage user records for TechHive Solutions. It supports full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and includes robust features such as input validation, logging, error handling, and simulated token-based authentication. This project was developed and enhanced with the help of Microsoft Copilot.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:**  
  - **GET** – Retrieve all users or a specific user by ID.
  - **POST** – Create a new user with proper validation.
  - **PUT** – Update an existing user’s details.
  - **DELETE** – Remove a user by ID.

- **Middleware Integration:**  
  - **Logging Middleware:** Logs HTTP requests and responses.
  - **Error-Handling Middleware:** Catches unhandled exceptions and returns standardized JSON error responses.
  - **Authentication Middleware:** Simulates token-based authentication to secure API endpoints.

- **Data Validation:**  
  - Utilizes data annotations and custom validations to ensure only valid user data is processed.

- **Swagger Integration:**  
  - Automatically generates interactive API documentation for easy testing and exploration of endpoints.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** ASP.NET Core 6 (or later)
- **Language:** C#
- **Libraries:** Newtonsoft.Json, System.Text.Json, NSwag
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Postman, GitHub, Microsoft Copilot

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub Account](https://github.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/UserManagementAPI.git
   cd UserManagementAPI
   ```

2. **Restore NuGet Packages:**

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Build the Project:**

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

5. **Access Swagger UI:**  
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/swagger` to explore and test the API endpoints interactively.

## Usage

### API Endpoints

- **GET /api/user**  
  Retrieve all users.

- **GET /api/user/{id}**  
  Retrieve a specific user by ID.

- **POST /api/user**  
  Create a new user.  
  _Example JSON Body:_
  ```json
  {
    "Name": "John Doe",
    "Email": "john.doe@example.com"
  }
  ```

- **PUT /api/user/{id}**  
  Update an existing user's details.

- **DELETE /api/user/{id}**  
  Delete a user by ID.

## Middleware

The project utilizes custom middleware components:

- **ErrorHandlingMiddleware:**  
  Catches unhandled exceptions, logs the error, and returns a standardized JSON error response.

- **AuthenticationMiddleware:**  
  Checks for the presence of a valid token in the request header and returns a 401 Unauthorized response if the token is missing or invalid.

- **LoggingMiddleware:**  
  Logs details of incoming HTTP requests (HTTP method, request path) and outgoing responses (status code).

## Copilot Contributions

Microsoft Copilot was used to:
- Scaffold initial project setup and boilerplate code.
- Generate CRUD endpoints and enhance API functionality.
- Identify and resolve bugs through improved code suggestions.
- Write and refine custom middleware for logging, error handling, and authentication.
- Optimize code for performance and security.

## Testing

The API has been tested using Postman:
- **CRUD Operations:** Verified creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of user records.
- **Validation:** Tested input validation to ensure proper error messages for invalid data.
- **Middleware:** Checked that logging, error handling, and authentication middleware function as expected.
- **Swagger:** Used the Swagger UI to interact with and test endpoints.
